## Why MDX ?

❤️ **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
React/JSX-based projects.

💻 **Everything is a component**: Use existing components inside your
MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.

🔧 **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
element (`{ h1: MyHeading }`).

📚 **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.

🔥 **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.
